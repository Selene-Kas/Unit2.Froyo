Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered. In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry froyo.

The user's input string is split into an array of strings.
A loop is used to iterate through the array of flavors.
An object is used to keep count of how many orders there are of each flavor.
The program correctly counts the number of each flavor in the user's input
The logic for counting the frequencies of elements in an array is organized into a function that returns an object.
The console output changes depending on the user's input.
